### Overview
Julienne will be a social networking platform for cullinary-minded individuals, designed with a simple interface in the spirit of Instagram and Twitter. This app will cut down (or julienne, if you will) all the unnecessary information that many recipe websites are bogged down with, and will place more of a focus on the creators of the recipes. I got the Idea for this when I was searching for a cheesecake recipe, and noticed how dated and bogged down with useless information most recipe sites are.
